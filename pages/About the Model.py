text = "Much of the coffee grown in the Philippines (about 85%) is the lower quality **Robusta** that is largely used to produce instant coffee. Robusta plantation are located in Bukidnon, Misamis Oriental, Sultan Kudarat, Bataan, Bohol, Cebu, Compostela Valley and Palawan and various other regions. The Nestle Company buys a large percentage of the harvest. Coffee was first brought to the Philippines by a Franciscan friar in 1749 and grew into a thriving industry. The coffee rust disease decimated crops at the end of the nineteenth century. Toward the end of the era of Spanish colonization the Philippines was a top coffee exporter but the coffee trade languished due to lack of support from the government, urbanization and other factors including previous global declines in coffee prices."
